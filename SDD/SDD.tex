\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overview}
This document is intended to be used by the developer of the TODO software.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
The stakeholder in the design is also the client.

\subsection{Definitions}
\setcounter{paragraph}{0}
\setcounter{subsubsection}{0}
\paragraph{Should:} Requirements with this marker are desired, but not crucial, and will be a part of the final deliverable contingent on time and progress.
\paragraph{TBD:} Acronym for To Be Determined. This is used in this document to signify that the information necessary for a part of this document is ``To Be Determined''.
\paragraph{TODO:} Working name of the project.
\paragraph{User:} The person, or persons, who operate or interact directly with the product.
\paragraph{Will:} Requirements with this marker are guaranteed to be in the final delivered product.
\paragraph{Item:} Item refers to a data object. This object is either an appointment or a task.
\paragraph{CSV:} CSV is an acronym for Comma Separated Value. This is a standard and common format of simple tabular data.

\subsection{References}
The {\tt 1998 - IEEE Standard for Information Technology -- Systems Design -- Software Design Descriptions} was referenced to produce this document.

\subsection{Project Management}
This project will use \e{Git} version control in conjunction with \e{GitHub} to keep track of changes. The repository can be reached at \url{https://github.com/blake6489/Community-Project-Tracking}.

\paragraph{Unique ID:} Non user editable \e{int}. This is the index value used for internal reference to the task.

\paragraph{New item:} \label{sec:New item} By running \e{new} the user will add new items to the list and enter the necessary data fields.
\paragraph{Working on top item in list:} \label{sec:Working on top} By running \e{top} the user will initiate the accumulation of time worked on the top item in the list. If there are no items in the list, the program will return test to the command shell stating \e{No items in list}.
\paragraph{Mark inactive:} \label{sec:Mark inactive} By running \e{inactivate [Unique ID]} the specified task will be marked inactive and removed from view.
\paragraph{Completed:} \label{sec:Completed} By running \e{complete} the top task in the list will be marked as inactive and completed, and the time worked will stop accumulating. The item will be moved to the Inactive list.
\paragraph{Done for now:} \label{sec:Done for now} By running \e{stop} the top task in the list will stop accumulating time worked.
\paragraph{Changing list order:} \label{sec:Change order} By running \e{move [Unique ID] [new priority]} the specified task will be moved to the specified priority position in the list, unless the prerequisites for that task are ahead of it. In this case the option will be given to move all prerequisites of this task to the specified position.
%%%%
\paragraph{Modify a user created field:} \label{sec:Modify} By running \e{modify [Unique ID] [option]} the specified task will be modified, with the given piece of data being changed to the given value.
\paragraph{Make item top priority:} \label{sec:Make top} By running \e{move [Unique ID] 0} he specified task will be moved to the top priority position in the list, unless the prerequisites for that task are ahead of it. In this case the option will be given to move all prerequisites of this task to the specified position.
%%%%
\paragraph{Delete:} \label{sec:Delete} There is no deletion functionality
%%%%
\paragraph{View complete list:} \label{sec:View complete list} By entering \e{all} the user will be able to see the entire complete list in the terminal.
\paragraph{Export complete list:} \label{sec:Export complete list} By entering \e{export} the user will be able to export the entire complete list to a \e{CSV} file.
%%%%
\subsection{Automatic actions}
%\setcounter{paragraph}{0}
%\setcounter{subsubsection}{0}
%\paragraph{Appointment} \label{sec:Auto appointments} The position of an appointment will change at an interval set by the user so that the appointment appears at the top of the list before it actually occurs. The position in the active list will be calculated by time till appointment divided by user defined update interval. With the soonest appointment calculated first.
\subsubsection{Sorting} \label{sec:Sorting}
The list the user sees will be sorted using th following rules.
\paragraph{Priority at creation time:} \label{sec:Sorting - Priority} When a task is added the user may provide a priority for that task. This number indicates how many elements below the top element this item should be. If this number is larger than the current number of elements the task is pushed as the last item in the list. After this the priority has no meaning as other items may be inserted or removed before it.
\paragraph{Appointment position in list:} \label{sec:Sorting - Appointment} 
\subparagraph{}When the active list is called to be shown the tasks will be copied into a temporary list and maintain their positions in the list relative to each other. 
\subparagraph{}The appointments will be inserted into the temporary list. 
\subparagraph{}The first appointment inserted will be the one farthest in the future. 
\subparagraph{}The position in the active list will be calculated by time till appointment divided by user defined update interval. 
\subparagraph{}If the calculated position is larger than the entire list, the appointment will be pushed onto the end of the list.

\section{Views}
\subsection{Viewing Active List}
The user will see the list of tasks and appointments to be done in order of priority. These tasks will be those that are not marked inactive, or completed. The number of items shown is specified by the user in the \e{config} file and defaults to 15 items.

\label{fig:table}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

\subsection{Viewing All} \label{sec:View all}
The user will see the entire list of work done on items regardless of completion status when executing the \e{all} or \e{export} functions.
This view will match the active items table above, but with a few additional columns.

\section{Interface}
\subsection{Terminal}
Using a command line interface would allow the TODO software to be used in an open Linux terminal. This interface option is for more limiting for typical users than a GUI but will be simpler to implement and will achieve the goals. The terminal would print out the active list in order of which priority and then leave a line at the bottom for the user to enter the commands listing the Actions section.

\subsection{Glade2}
Glade2 is a possible user interface design tool that would allow TODO to be implemented in a C++ GUI.  


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Test Cases}
A set of automatic tests will be written to perform inputs on the system and the outputs will be checked by a human.  The state that the system should finish each test in is known but not easily testable.  Most of the tests will be to ensure that improper actions are not executed and that the data is not corrupted.
