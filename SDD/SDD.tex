\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overview}
This document is intended to be used by the developer of the TODO software.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
The stakeholder in the design is also the client.

\subsection{Definitions}
\setcounter{paragraph}{0}
\setcounter{subsubsection}{0}
\paragraph{Should:} Requirements with this marker are desired, but not crucial, and will be a part of the final deliverable contingent on time and progress.
\paragraph{TBD:} Acronym for To Be Determined. This is used in this document to signify that the information necessary for a part of this document is ``To Be Determined''.
\paragraph{User:} The person, or persons, who operate or interact directly with the product.
\paragraph{Will:} Requirements with this marker are guaranteed to be in the final delivered product.
\paragraph{Item:} Item refers to a data object. This object is either an appointment or a task.
\paragraph{CSV:} CSV is an acronym for Comma Separated Value. This is a standard and common format of simple tabular data.

\subsection{References}
The {\tt 1998 - IEEE Standard for Information Technology -- Systems Design -- Software Design Descriptions} was referenced to produce this document.
