\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overview}
This document is intended to be used by the developer of the TODO software.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
The stakeholder in the design is also the client.

\subsection{Definitions}
\setcounter{paragraph}{0}
\setcounter{subsubsection}{0}
\paragraph{GUI:} Acronym for Graphical User Interface. Used to refer to the look and feel the user experiences.
\paragraph{Immediately:} Immediately refers to actions that will begin as soon as the user has given the input for the action to occur.
\paragraph{Should:} Requirements with this marker are desired, but not crucial, and will be a part of the final deliverable contingent on time and progress.
\paragraph{TBD:} Acronym for To Be Determined. This is used in this document to signify that the information necessary for a part of this document is ``To Be Determined''.
\paragraph{Client:} Julie Engfer, the Office Manager for Festival of Fairbanks.
\paragraph{User:} The person, or persons, who operate or interact directly with the product.
\paragraph{Administrator:} A user with special permissions as specified in section 3.1.2 User Management.
\paragraph{Will:} Requirements with this marker are guaranteed to be in the final delivered product.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{CPT:} Internal name of the application and java package.
%\paragraph{User:} A person who uses the software directly. All users will have individual login accounts.
%any alternatives to 'worker'
\paragraph{Worker:} The person(s) responsible for the work done on a timesheet. A User has a corresponding Worker, but there may be Workers without User accounts, e.g., "boyscouts."
\paragraph{Project:} Seen at top of timesheet, e.g., "Bicycle Path."
\paragraph{Program:} A project which occurs annually, e.g., "Clean Team."
\paragraph{Activity:} Left column of timesheet, e.g., "Ice Chipping."
\paragraph{Location:} Top row of timesheet, e.g., "CORE 1st - 3rd." The word "location" isn't actually on the sheet.
%one or the other?
\paragraph{Tool/Equipment:} Corresponds to "Equipment Used" on the original timesheet. This is the implement used to complete a Task
\paragraph{Task:} The data entered into a timesheet is stored in Tasks, a record comprising a Project, Worker, Activity, Location, Tool, date, hours worked and a comment.
\paragraph{Comment:} Remarks by a User to be stored with their Task record.
\paragraph{Timesheet:} The name for the web page on which the various data are entered.

\subsection{References}
The {\tt 1998 - IEEE Standard for Information Technology -- Systems Design -- Software Design Descriptions} was referenced to produce this document.

\section{Design Considerations}

\subsection{Programming Languages}
Groovy on Grails \\
We chose this development platform on the basis that it will be easy to create a simple web application wit a database back end.

\subsection{Project Management}
This project will use \e{Git} version control in conjunction with \e{GitHub} to keep track of changes. The repository can be reached at \url{https://github.com/blake6489/Community-Project-Tracking}.
The meeting notes will be stored on Google Docs and visible to all developers of the project.
