\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Document for Community Project Tracking is for use by the customer and development team. This document is a formal listing of the functional and non-functional requirements of the Community Project Tracking system.

\subsection{Scope}
The Community Project Tracking software will assist users in the storing and summary of various activity data.

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{GUI:} Acronym for Graphical User Interface. Used to refer to the look and feel the user experiences.
\item \textbf{Immediately:} Immediately refers to actions that will begin as soon as the user has given the input for the action to occur.
\item \textbf{Should:} Requirements with this marker are desired, but not crucial, and will be a part of the final deliverable contingent on time and progress.
\item \textbf{TBD:} Acronym for To Be Determined. This is used in this document to signify that the information necessary for a part of this document is ``To Be Determined''.
\item \textbf{User:} The person, or persons, who operate or interact directly with the product.
\item \textbf{Will:} Requirements with this marker are guaranteed to be in the final delivered product.
\end{enumerate}
