README

Would this be an ok place to discuss stuff?

I think we could use a more elegent name.  Ask Julie to name it?

Think I got most of the CI server stuff figured out.  We can go over setting it up on Blake's account on Tuesday.  In the meantime, get an account here: https://grandcentral.cloudbees.com/account/signup

How to import the grails app into sts

On the commandline:
cd code/CommunityProjectTracking/
grails integrate-with --eclipse

Then in sts:
File > import...
General >  Existing Projects into Workspace
Select root directory: code/CommunityProjectTracking/

NOTE if you imported previously: I removed the hypens from the name due to the way java packages were being generated with them.
Not sure how a git merge will affect things, but you may need to erase .project and rerun grails integrate-with --eclipse.
